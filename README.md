# sevenguis
This project was inspired by this site: [7GUIS](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) and a desire to try this out in Godot Engine. 
The web based results of each project can be found on this website: [Seven GUIS](https://triptych.neocities.org/sevenguis/index.html). The idea is to implement each coding challenge in Godot Engine as a way to learn Godot, and to see how challenging the Seven GUI's are to make in Godot.
